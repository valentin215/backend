# Shipup Backend Challenge

## Guidelines

**For each level, write code that generates a `data/output.json` file from `data/input.json`.
An `expected_output.json` file is available to give you a reference on what result is expected.**

- Clone this repo (do **not** fork it)
- Solve the levels in ascending order
- Only do one commit per level

## Pointers

You can have a look at the higher levels, but please do the simplest thing that could work for the level you're currently solving.

The levels become more complex over time, so you will probably have to re-use some code and adapt it to the new requirements.

For higher levels we are interested in seeing code that is clean, extensible and robust, so don't overlook edge cases, use exceptions where needed, ...

Please also note that:

- Running `$ ruby main.rb` from the level folder should generate the desired output, but of course feel free to add more files if needed.
- Alternatively, you can use any programming language to solve this exercise. In that case, simply ignore the main.rb file

## Sending Your Results

Once you are done, please send your results to someone from Shipup.

You can send your Github project link or zip your directory and send it via email.
If you do not use Github, don't forget to attach your `.git` folder.

Good luck!
