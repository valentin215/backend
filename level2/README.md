# Level 2

- Carriers will not work on Sundays.
- Some carriers will work on Saturdays while some others won't.
- When a carrier isn't working, package deliveries will not make any progress on that day. The delivery will thus be postponed by 1 day.

Adapt the expected delivery computation to take these new rules into account.
